The program has grown to full blown pdf to png converter.Despite it's name, pdf2img supports up to 4 different image extensions and 10 different sdevices.

Always keep "From page number" lower than "To". From 10 To 90 - OK , From 90 To 10 - Not working

GNU/Linux users will be more than happier to use it :)
