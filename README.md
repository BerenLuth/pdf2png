About
=======

With pdf2img you have the opportunity to convert PDF to image with a single mouse click. pdf2img supports up to 4 different image extensions and 10 different sdevices.

##How To

Increasing or decreasing the resolution will change the image quality.

Once given correct numbers for the From page and To page, click on Select PDF file to open a dialog window to browse and select the wanted PDF book, and click on Convert to convert the selected pages.

It would convert the pdf and output the image(s) in the same directory where the pdf resides.
