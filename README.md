About
=======

With pdf2png you have the opportunity to convert PDF to image with a single mouse click. pdf2png supports up to 4 different image extensions like PNG,JPEG,BMP and TIFF.

##How To

Increasing or decreasing the resolution will change the image quality.

Once given correct numbers for the From page and To page, click on Select PDF file to open a dialog window to browse and select the wanted PDF book, and click on Convert to convert the selected pages.

It would convert the pdf and output the image(s) in the same directory where the pdf resides.

##Credits

Forked from WifiExtender's <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/pdf2png">pdf2img</a>, so Thanks to him :)

This has minor chnages from his version like no tray icon and no over-riding of the system theme.

For Arch Linux users check out <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pdf2png/">pdf2png</a> in the AUR.

## Requirements

* python 
* ghostscript
* python-gobject (for debian its python-gi)
