The program has grown to full blown pdf to img converter. Now pdf2img supports up to 4 different image extensions and 10 different sdevices.

Always keep "From page number" lower than "To". From 10 To 90 - OK

GNU/Linux users will be more than happier to use it :)

11/11/13 name changed, from pdf2png to pdf2img and I'm saying huge THANK YOU to aaditya for the mention of "jpeg" which made me to add selection for image extensions and more sDevices, also to rename the program name.
